Power consumption estimate

+24V power supply -> DC-DC converter (+12V) -> Arduino
Arduino -> Relay module -> Cryogenic valve <- +24V power supply
Arduino <-> RS485 module <-> Temperature sensor
Arduino -> Display

Most of the power will be in the Cryogenic valve. Using the initial valve
supplied, it runs at 24V, 1A when ON. We assume the initial cooling (2 min)
to be 50%, and subsequent steady state to be 20%. Hence, the energy is
estimated to be

24 x 1 x 0.5 x (2/60) + 24 x 1 x 0.2 x (58/60) = 5.04 Whr

The rest of the control system - Arduino, DC-DC converter, RS485 module,
temperature sensor etc consumes less than 0.5 Whr of energy. Hence, the total
energy consumption of the controller is estimated to be 6 Whr.
